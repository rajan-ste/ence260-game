A two player paper sissors rock game for the UCFK4. Created by Katie Ryan and Rajan Stephens

By loading the makefile onto the funkit the game can be played. This is done by using _make program_ in the terminal.

The game starts in a start menu which shows scrolling text "press to start". Once boht funkits have pressed the navswitch the game will move into play mode. By pushing the navswitch in different directions the action rock, sissors or paper can be selected. To confirm the action press the navswitch down to send your choice to the other player. Once both players have selected their action the result will be calculated and shown on the screen. 

Like in classic paper sissors rock the logic is as follows, 
- rock beats sissors
- sissors beats paper 
- paper beats rock
- same action is a draw
