A two player paper scissors rock game for the UCFK4. Created by Katie Ryan and Rajan Stephens

By loading the makefile onto the funkit the game can be played. This is done by using _make program_ in the terminal.

The game starts in a start menu which shows scrolling text "press to start". Once both funkits have pressed the navswitch, the game will move into select mode. Once in select mode each player must select their move:

- To choose paper press the navswitch up (north)
- To choose scissors press the navswitch right (east)
- To choose rock press the navswitch down (south)

 To confirm the action press the navswitch down to send your choice to the other player. Once both players have selected their action via pushing the navswitch each player's result will be calculated and shown on the respective screen. 

Like in classic paper scissors rock the logic is as follows, 
- rock beats scissors
- scissors beats paper 
- paper beats rock
- same action is a draw
